It's fairly straightforward to use, however, it is not currently available on mobile devices.

Technologies used to build this app include but are not limited to the following:

* HTML, CSS & JQuery to build the basic skeleton of the webpage
* Tailwind CSS Framework to visually enhance the webpage
* Node.js and Express.js to build the server
* PostCSS, PurgeCSS, CSSNano, and Watch plugins to dynamically change and drastically reduce the size of the Tailwind.css file
* JQuery.scrollto to scroll between sections with ease
